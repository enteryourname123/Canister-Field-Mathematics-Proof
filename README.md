# Canister Field Mathematics™ – Prior Art & Proof Repository  
## Public Timestamped Evidence for CFM™ and the Virtual Quantum Computer (VQC)

This repository serves as the **official prior-art package** for:

- **Canister Field Mathematics (CFM™)**
- **Canister Field Processor (CFP)**
- **Virtual Quantum Computer (VQC) on the Internet Computer (ICP)**
- **Quantum-Inspired Computational Model derived from canister fields**

Its purpose is to provide a **public, immutable, timestamped and cryptographically verifiable record** of the discovery and formulation of the CFM computational paradigm.

## 📁 Repository Contents (Proof Documents)

### **1. Priority Notes**
These documents establish the *original conception and development* of the CFM model:

- **`1A_Priority_Note.pdf`**  
  Foundational description of the CFM model, motivations, analogy to computing substrates, and early architecture.

- **`2A_Priority_Note.pdf`**  
  Complementary detail expanding the mathematical framework, computational model, and mapping to a virtual quantum machine.

Together, these form the earliest documentary evidence of the invention.

### **2. Proof Certificates & External Evidence**

- **`Proof_Certificate_v2.pdf`**  
  Timestamp certificates, OpenTimestamps data, and evidence of file existence on decentralized storage.

- **IPFS CIDs**  
QmPDXdfdMEvdP785zaMLLU4XfjLFJTqBB6wg5q85AcErrh

Zkopírovat kód

- **ArDrive / Arweave TX IDs**  
(Add if available.)

- **ICP Ledger Memo Hash**  
(Add if available.)

These provide **cryptographically verifiable timestamp proofs** independent of GitHub.

### **3. `hashes.txt` (SHA-256 Integrity File)**  
This file contains the SHA-256 hashes of every document in the repository, ensuring tamper-proof traceability:

SHA256(1A_Priority_Note.pdf) = …
SHA256(2A_Priority_Note.pdf) = …
SHA256(Proof_Certificate_v2.pdf) = …

## ⚖️ Licensing & Intended Usage

The author intends the following:

1. **The CFM™ model is freely usable** for research, education, experimentation, and beneficial purposes.  
2. **Commercial or production use** of systems implementing CFM-based computation should:  
   - Provide clear attribution to the original author.  
   - Donate **20% of net profits** from computation using this model to the **nearest church or charitable institution** at the location where the computation is performed.  
3. No restriction on open-source publication; **third-party patenting is explicitly discouraged**.

A formal license may be added later (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA + Custom Ethical Clause).

Priority Note — Canister Field Mathematics (CFM™)

This repository serves as a public, timestamped, and immutable record of the existence,
authorship, and contents of the mathematical framework known as *Canister Field
Mathematics (CFM™)*.

Included documents contain the original formal definition of the CFM mathematical
model and related derivations.

To strengthen time-proof, the same documents have been uploaded to multiple
independent decentralized storage layers:

• Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
  - Transaction hash: 3acc72ee3ffcfdc41b6478707d23fe5c6e9ba55ad0ecac4810f8700545351c32

• IPFS
  - CID: QmPDXdfdMEvdP785zaMLLU4XfjLFJTqBB6wg5q85AcErrh

• ArDrive / Arweave
  - TXID: 9LRyePFLvcWFxs2be_KcYZ2gjWA_7v7mhGzDvSzrHpI

This repository acts as a publicly verifiable prior-art disclosure in accordance
with global patent and copyright standards.
